# hery-web-start-kit
This is my web start kit! Just pull down and run cmd 'npm run dev'
## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
cnpm install (You should install cnpm first!)

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run all tests
npm test
```
